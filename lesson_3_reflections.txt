When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	When a project is reviewed and/or worked by others.
	When working remotely.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To not mess up local repository. I'd rather check changes on remote
	and only then sync.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	Clones are copies of repos, forks are similar to clones but made but GitHub
	online and become clones when pulled to local machines. Branches are parts of the same commits sequence and in a way depend on it. Clones and forks can be used when user have no edit permissions on a repository but is allowed to copy it and work on that copy. Branches are suitable to work on different parts of a project interchangeably.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
